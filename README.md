### **README**
This is my Binarium auto trading bot. <br> Instructions, bot settings and feedback are implemented through the telegram bot.
When the instruction received, bot analyzes it, and then opens a web browser using Selenium webdriver and executes the instructions given to it.
Instructions example: <br>

> /autobet `Option` `Expiration Time` `Direction(up/down)` <br>

After that not parse and set up option, expiration time and direction. After that bot open deal and send to telegram channel required info.
### Periodically site upgrades, so some features will may not working. Wait for updates
